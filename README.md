# File Breakdown
## Results
**Folders Character fits, Linear fit, sqrt fits, and sinusoidal fits:** visualizes how each of the four models performed when fitting at different learning rates, expansion/hidden layer ratio, and convergence rates

**Model Performance CSV**: Demonstrates the numerical error and convergence epochs each model ended with

**Character_Trajecotry_Performance:** Figure 5 in paper

**Convergence_Across_Models:** Figure 4 in Paper

## Executables
**CBM.py**: used to train and test both models

**MarrAlbusModel.py:** class MarrAlbus

**ffnn,py:** class feed forward network

**make_plots:** used to create the figures
